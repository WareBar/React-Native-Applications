# React Native UI
### What is React Native? 
#### React Native is a popular open-source framework that allows developers to build mobile applications for various platforms, primarily iOS and Android, using JavaScript. Here's a breakdown of key aspects:
#### Cross-Platform Development:
A major advantage of React Native is its ability to create applications that can run on multiple platforms from a single codebase. This significantly reduces development time and costs.   
Based on React:
React Native is built on top of React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. This allows web developers familiar with React to easily transition to mobile app development.   
Native Rendering:
Unlike some other cross-platform frameworks, React Native renders native UI components. This means that applications built with React Native look and feel like native apps, providing a better user experience.   
Developed by Meta:
React Native was developed by Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook), which contributes to its ongoing development and support.   
In essence, React Native empowers developers to create high-performance mobile applications using JavaScript, leveraging the power of native platform capabilities.
